## Problem Statement
In this project, I am putting myself in the shoes of a Data Analyst working in a market research firm called Nourish Nexus.
Nourish Nexus is in collaboration with a retail vendor that specializes in food and beverage products.

My client is a small company and they are still learning their market and evaluating their customers. 
As a Data Analyst, I have just been handed the marketing data. The client would like me to build a Power BI report that will show insights in a few specific areas of interest: 

- How are our six (6) marketing campaigns and products performing?
- Who are our customers?
- What is driving our campaign performance and buyer decision making?


### Steps followed 

- *__Step 1__* : Loaded the csv dataset into Power BI Desktop and reviewed it. Before transformation, the dataset had **28 columns, 2241 rows.**

- *__Step 2__* : Transformed the dataset to fit the task with which it is to be used for. Some of the transformations carried out includes, but not limited to, extracting the customer age from their year of birth, checking the columns for missing and incorrect values and replacing where necessary, renaming some of the column names for clarity.

- *__Step 3__*: Data Modelling: After a careful review of the dataset, I realized that the dataset, though a good data, but would be better when modelled to improve organization and clarity, enhance performance and greater flexibility during analysis. So, I modelled the dataset as seen in the screenshot below.

- *__Step 4__*: Data Analysis: Having tranformed and modelled the dataset, it was now ready for analysis to meet the clients need. During the analysis, the dataset was transformed a little more to further derive some insights based on a pattern seen. 
For instance, the dataset showed that Campaign 6 got the most number of unit sale *(from L-R, chart 1)* and the most sales (chart 2), then I decided to see the average sales per Campaign and the dataset showed that Campaigned 5 was 2x better than the others.

## Key Findings
While this dataset have many other stories it could tell and insights that could be derived from it, the report snapshots and insights that will follow were limited on the needs of the client.
Therefore, it is a 3 page report, with each page answering each of the clients question.

### 1. How did their six marketing campaigns and products performing?

The analysis shows that Campaigns 5 and 6 were the most successful in terms of sales and revenue. Wines were consistently the top-performing product category, driving the highest sales across campaigns. The data also shows a preference for In-Store and Catalogue sales channels, with Campaign 6 being particularly effective in leveraging these channels to maximize revenue. See screenshot below


### 2. Who are their customers? 
The Nourish Nexus Customer Composition analysis page provides a detailed look into the demographics, purchasing behavior, and preferences of the customer base.

Below are insights derived from each chart and a general summary of the findings.

The customer base of Nourish Nexus is primarily mature, married, and well-educated, with a significant portion of customers holding higher degrees and having relatively high incomes. The purchasing behavior is diversified across age groups, with younger customers showing interest in a wider range of products and older customers preferring wines and meat products.
